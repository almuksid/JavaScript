// Steven wants you to improve his tip calculator, using the same rules as before â€” tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 20%

/* Write your code below. Good luck! ðŸ™‚ */
const calcTip = function(bill) {
    return bill >= 50 && bill <=300 ? bill * .15 : bill * .20;
}

const bills = [125, 555, 44]

const tips = [calcTip(bills[0]), calcTip(bills[1]), calcTip(bills[2])]

const total =[ bills[0] + tips[0], bills[1] + tips[1], bills[2] + tips[2], ]

console.log(bills, tips, total);
